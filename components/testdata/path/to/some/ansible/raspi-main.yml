##
# This Ansible playbook is specifically designed to set up all
# Raspberry Pi nides in my  homelab environment. All RasPi nodes tun on top of
# Ubuntu Server or Rapsberry Pi OS (which is based on Debian). So this playbook
# can utilize tasks which were originally written for Raspberry Pi nodes.
#
# The purpose of this Ansible playbook is to automate the setup and configuration of
# Raspberry Pi nodes my homelab. It ensures that these machines are equipped with all
# the necessary software, configurations, and development tools required for efficient work.
#
# * The playbook includes configurations for setting up user accounts, defining user permissions, and configuring user-specific settings like `.bashrc` settings and SSH keys.
# * The playbook installs all the needed software required for daily and development tasks.
# * The playbook installs a comprehensive set of development tools necessary for software development and operations.
#
# This Ansible playbook streamlines the process of setting up Raspberry Pi nodes development
# purposes and (recurring) operations tasks, ensuring that they are equipped with the
# necessary software, configurations, and development tools. Additionally, it provides a
# version-controlled and easily reproducible way to maintain my  homelab environment,
# ensuring that all Raspberry Pi nodes are always up-to-date and configured according to
# specifications.
#
# == Prerequisites
#
# The `xref:AUTO-GENERATED:components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli-sh.adoc[components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli.sh]`
# script, which takes care of running this playbook, expects Docker to be installed. A
# local Ansible installation is not needed. When starting on a fresh system without any
# additional packages installed, start with the `* xref:AUTO-GENERATED:components/homelab/src/main/bootstrap/install-basics-sh.adoc[components/homelab/src/main/bootstrap/install-basics.sh]`
# script to make sure all requirements are met.

# Install Steam on link:https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop[Ubuntu Desktop] machines.
#
# == Prerequisites
#
# The ``xref:AUTO-GENERATED:components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli-sh.adoc[components/homelab/src/main/ansible-cli.sh]``
# script, which takes care of running this playbook, expects Docker to be installed. A
# local Ansible installation is not needed. When starting on a fresh system without any
# additional packages installed, start with the ``* xref:AUTO-GENERATED:components/homelab/src/main/bootstrap/install-basics-sh.adoc[components/homelab/src/main/bootstrap/install-basics.sh]``
# script to make sure all requirements are met.

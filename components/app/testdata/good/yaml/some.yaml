## This Docker Compose file handles three responsibilities:
##
## . Linting the project files to ensure they adhere to coding standards.
## . Building the source2adoc application.
## . Testing the application.
##
## When running docker-compose up, all services are orchestrated to execute sequentially, ensuring
## the project is linted, built, and tested efficiently within the Docker environment.

= How to write the inline docs
Sebastian Sommerfeld <sebastian@sommerfeld.io>

All supported languages share the `#` as marker for their comments. However source2adoc does not consider every comment worthy of being rendered into the documentation. Only comments that are specifically marked are considered relevant.

== Mark comments for source2adoc
The `##` symbol is used as a marker for comments that should be considered for conversion into AsciiDoc format. These comments are meant to be read, parsed, and converted into AsciiDoc during the conversion process.

Inside the `##` comments, the comments can use AsciiDoc syntax to format the text.

Adding `xref` and `link` is supported, although it is work noting that source2adoc does not validate whether the references are valid.

Even adding tables and code blocks into directly a `##` comment is supported.

Additionally, inside the `##` comments, the following tags are supported to provide a more structured way of writing the comments:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Tag & Parameter |Usage
|`@see reference` |Provides a link to another element of documentation (generates `xref`)
|`@param name description` |Describes a method parameter.
|`@return description` |Describes the return value.
|`@exitcode code description` |Describes the exit code of a (bash) method.
|`@deprecated description` |Describes an outdated method.
|`@link reference` |Link to external resource  (generates `link`).

== Examples
[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
## I am just a dummy script to present a valid source2adoc comment for bash scripts.
## This would be the position where the header docs would be placed. This should document the whole file.
##
## [source, bash]
## ....
## ./demo.sh
## ....
##
## NOTE: You could also add a table here.
##
## @exitcode 0 when everything worked just fine

# Comments like this will not be part of the generated documentation
echo "I am just a dummy script to present a valid source2adoc comment for bash scripts"

For more complex examples, see https://github.com/sommerfeld-io/source2adoc/tree/main/components/app/internal/testdata. This testdata directory contains examples for all supported languages. ALl these testdata files are used within out automated build and test process, so it is ensured that these comments all are supported.

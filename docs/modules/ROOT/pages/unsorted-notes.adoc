= Unsorted Notes

== Additional Suggestions for "source2adoc" Project

. Template Customization
.. Provide options for users to customize the template used for generating AsciiDoc files. This could include defining headers, footers, and other styling elements to align with the project's branding or documentation standards.
. Interactive Documentation
.. Explore the possibility of integrating interactive elements into the generated AsciiDoc files. This could include embedded code snippets with runnable examples or interactive diagrams to enhance understanding and engagement.
. Versioning Support
.. Implement support for versioning within the generated documentation. This could involve automatically extracting version information from source code repositories or allowing users to specify version numbers manually.
. Integration with Documentation Platforms
.. Consider integrating "source2adoc" with popular documentation platforms other than Antora. This could include platforms like Read the Docs, GitBook, or Sphinx, providing flexibility for users with different documentation preferences.
. Continuous Improvement
.. Continuously gather feedback from users and iterate on the tool based on their needs and suggestions. Regular updates and improvements will help ensure that "source2adoc" remains relevant and useful in evolving development environments.
. Error Handling and Logging
.. Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to provide users with meaningful feedback in case of errors or issues during the generation process. This will help users diagnose and troubleshoot problems more effectively.
. Documentation and Examples
.. Provide comprehensive documentation and examples to guide users in understanding how to use the tool effectively. Include usage examples, best practices, and troubleshooting tips to support users at all levels of experience.

By incorporating these suggestions, you can enhance the functionality, usability, and reliability of the "source2adoc" project, making it a valuable tool for developers seeking to streamline their documentation workflows.

=== MY IDEA
Think about how to design/assemble the index page with links to the docs pages … don’t write too much explaining text. No one needs this and reads this. Take a look at the ansible docs for ideas.

== Conversation on Structuring a Kotlin App for Generating AsciiDoc
=== Introduction
In this conversation, we discuss the structuring of a Kotlin application for generating AsciiDoc from inline docs, while interacting with a Git repository.

=== Proposed Code Structure
Below is the proposed structure for the Kotlin app:

[options="header"]
|===
|Layer | Description | Example

| User Interface Layer (Controller)
| Handles user interactions and delegates tasks to the service layer.
| AppController

| Service Layer
| Intermediary between the user interface and implementation details. Encapsulates business logic.
| DocumentationService

| Implementation Details
| Responsible for specific tasks like reading code files and generating AsciiDoc.
| CodeReader, AsciidocWriter

| Model
| Data models for representing inline docs, code files, etc.
| InlineDoc, CodeFile

| Main Function
| Entry point of the application.
| main()

|===

=== Code Examples
[source,kotlin]
----
class AppController(private val documentationService: DocumentationService) {
    fun generateAsciiDoc(repoPath: String) {
        // Collect user input, handle errors if necessary
        val inlineDocs == documentationService.extractInlineDocsFromRepo(repoPath)
        // Display output or errors
    }
}

class DocumentationService(private val codeReader: CodeReader, private val asciidocWriter: AsciidocWriter) {
    fun extractInlineDocsFromRepo(repoPath: String): List<InlineDoc> {
        // Use codeReader to read code files from the repository
        // Extract inline docs from code files
        // Return inline docs
    }

    fun generateAsciiDoc(inlineDocs: List<InlineDoc>): String {
        // Use asciidocWriter to generate AsciiDoc from inline docs
        // Return generated AsciiDoc
    }
}

class CodeReader {
    fun readCodeFiles(repoPath: String): List<CodeFile> {
        // Use Git library or command-line tools to read code files from the repository
        // Return a list of code files
    }
}

class AsciidocWriter {
    fun generateAsciiDoc(inlineDocs: List<InlineDoc>): String {
        // Generate AsciiDoc from inline docs
        // Return generated AsciiDoc
    }
}

data class InlineDoc(val content: String)

data class CodeFile(val name: String, val content: String)

fun main() {
    val codeReader == CodeReader()
    val asciidocWriter == AsciidocWriter()
    val documentationService == DocumentationService(codeReader, asciidocWriter)
    val appController == AppController(documentationService)

    appController.generateAsciiDoc("/path/to/your/git/repo")
}
----

=== Conclusion
This structure ensures separation of concerns and modularity, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and test.

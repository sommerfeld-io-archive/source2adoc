= Publish a new Release
Sebastian Sommerfeld <sebastian@sommerfeld.io>

`metadata/NEXT_VERSION` contains the next version, which should be used for the git tag and to tag the Docker images.

The file is also copied to `components/app/internal/metadata/VERSION` to display the version inside the app. Keep in mind that during local development and for release candidates, the `--version` command returns a version that is not yet released

To trigger a release, manually run the Release Workflow. The pipeline picks up all information from the metadata files and triggers a release. Keep in mind that you have to update `metadata/NEXT_VERSION` with the next version in line.

CAUTION: TODO lint current and next version. not allowed to be the same.

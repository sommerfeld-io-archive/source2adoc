== Context
The source2adoc CLI tool xref:architecture-decisions/adr-003-open-source.adoc[has been made open source], and we need to choose an appropriate open source license. The tool is intended to remain open source indefinitely, and it is essential that any forks of the project maintain a reference to the original author and the original project, including links to the project's GitHub repository.

Several licenses could be suitable for our needs, each with its own strengths and limitations. Specifically, we will consider the MIT License, the GNU General Public License (GPL), and the Apache License. We may also explore additional licenses if they provide a better fit for our requirements.

== Decision
After evaluating the options, we will choose the GNU General Public License (GPL) for the source2adoc CLI tool. This decision is based on the following comparison:

=== MIT License
The MIT License is a permissive license that allows for significant freedom. It permits users to do almost anything with the project, including making and distributing closed-source versions. The main requirements are that the original license and copyright notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

. Pros
.. Very permissive, allowing broad use and integration.
.. Simple and easy to understand.
. Cons
.. Does not enforce any requirement for derivative works to be open source.
.. Less protection against potential patent litigation compared to the Apache License.

=== Apache License 2.0
The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license similar to the MIT License but includes additional provisions for patent rights and more detailed requirements for attribution.

. Pros
.. Permissive, allowing for broad use, similar to the MIT License.
.. Includes explicit grants of patent rights, providing more legal protection.
.. Requires preservation of the original attribution in derivative works.
. Cons
.. More complex than the MIT License, though still relatively straightforward.
.. Does not enforce any requirement for derivative works to be open source.

=== GNU General Public License (GPL)
Specifically the GNU General Public License (Version 3, 29 June 2007): The GPL is a copyleft license that requires any derivative works to also be licensed under the GPL. This ensures that the project and any derivatives remain open source.

. Pros
.. Ensures that all derivative works remain open source, aligning with our goal to keep the project open source indefinitely.
.. Strongly protects the freedom of end-users.
.. Ensures attribution by requiring that all copies and substantial portions of the software include the original license and copyright notice.
. Cons
.. Can be restrictive for businesses that want to integrate the software into proprietary systems.
.. The strict copyleft nature may deter some potential contributors or users.

== Consequences
Choosing the GNU General Public License (GPL) will have the following consequences:

=== Positive Consequences
. Ensured Openness: The GPL's copyleft nature ensures that all derivative works remain open source, preserving the tool's open-source nature indefinitely.
. User Freedom: Strongly protects the freedom of end-users, aligning with the principles of open source.
. Attribution: The GPL ensures that any forks of the project will maintain a reference to the original author and project, including links to the project's GitHub repository.

=== Negative Consequences
. Commercial Use Restrictions: The GPL can be restrictive for businesses that want to integrate the software into proprietary systems, potentially limiting the tool's adoption in commercial environments.
. Contributor Deterrence: The strict copyleft nature may deter some potential contributors or users who prefer more permissive licensing terms.

=== Neutral Consequences
. Legal Protection: While the GPL does not explicitly provide the same patent protections as the Apache License, it ensures that the software and its derivatives remain free and open, which can indirectly mitigate some legal risks.

By adopting the GNU General Public License (GPL), we aim to ensure the source2adoc CLI tool remains open source indefinitely, protecting user freedoms and maintaining proper attribution across all derivative works.

== Development on your local machine

=== Prerequisites
Having Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and the Dev Container plugin installed are essential prerequisites for this development environment. The application is developed on Ubuntu 23.10 with Docker 26.1.2.

== Publish a new Release
`metadata/NEXT_VERSION` contains the next version, which should be used for the git tag and to tag the Docker images.

The file is also copied to `components/app/internal/metadata/VERSION` to display the version inside the app. Keep in mind that during local development and for release candidates, the `--version` command returns a version that is not yet released

To trigger a release, manually run the Release Workflow. The pipeline picks up all information from the metadata files and triggers a release. Keep in mind that you have to update `metadata/NEXT_VERSION` with the next version in line.
